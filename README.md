# StatsUtil
A package with helpful functions. I'm using this as a library for labwork and assignments of data science certification classes 
at Rockhurst and for other personal projects. These are  really basic functions like min-max normalization, sapply/lapply 
on dataframes to count na or scale features. I'll continue to add more functions as I discover more. This is my effortto facilitate code reuse 
and not having to copy-paste or memorize/rewrite these functions in each assignment/project.
